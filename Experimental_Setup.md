# Experimental Design

For the Purposes of this description we will use:

- The words **primary task** to describe the navigation the end goal.

- The words **secondary task** to describe the completion of the object rotation task 
that will require the operator to look to a secondary screen.

- The words **side task** to describe any tasks that the operator might be required to complete 
while working towards the end goal.

- Those tasks might include:
Working towards a Zone of Interest
Evaluating environmental parameters in said ZOI , such as hazards, victim recognition, etc. 

- The words **Zone of Interest (ZOI)** will be indicative of certain areas 
along the course of the robot towards the end goal that could contain points of interest.

- The words **Points of Interest (POI)** include various evnironmental parameters (hazards, victims, etc.)

**Enviromental Setup**

We could try for open arena with obstacles and the operator will have to navigate around certain 
way points and complete a secondary task while also having to go through zones of interest and collect data related to points of interest. 

An alternaite would be the:

Use of a corridor arrangement with an endgoal and some zones of interest along the way. 

The operator would be asked to move towards the endgoal while completing a secondary task.

Along the way he would have explore various zones of interest and record information on possible points of interest in those areas. 

Those zones of interest could be presented as siderooms along the corridor. 

**Experimental Evaluation**

The factors used to evaluate the performance of the system will be:

- The total time needed for completing the primary task , secondary task and side tasks. 

- The number of OI and RI LOA changes

- The result of the NASA workload test

> Further research should be performed on the factor of decision fatigue

- The number of successful and unsuccessful resolutions of conflict of control whitout an OI LOA change
