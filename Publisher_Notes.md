**Smoothing Factor Calibration**


We want to adjust the smoothing factor in a way that will include the time needed for the operator
to focus his attention to the secondary task or go back to controlling the robot


We must analyze the data from the experiment and find the average time needed for completing each 
secondary task after the first one vs the time needed to complete the first one.

   - We are assuming the time difference can indicate how long the operator needed to adjust before 
   being fully focused to the secondary task. 

   - Likewise on the cases that the user finished the secondary task and initiated a loa change to teleop
   the time that was needed for that change could be used as an indication of the time needed 
   to adjust their attention back to the primary task.



# **Attention Value Range**

**Mini trial** to evaluate the range that would be consired as attending or not to the screen 


We need to follow a standardized procedure in order to measure the average values of the angles 
related to looking and not looking at the screen 

- The subject will be have to be seated in front of the camera/screen setup 
at an average distance that is considered a comfortable operating distance by them 

- The height of the operator's head will be taken into account but will not be normalised in order
to have a more diverse range of values 

- We will ask each subject to look directly at the center of the screen. 
Then look the left and the right of the screen until the point they consider that the 
main screen is not longer comfortably visible to them.

This way we can assume that the angles gathered are similar to the angles of head rotation that 
an operator would demonstrate in the field.
